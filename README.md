# Curved Lanes Detection

## Problem Statement

The aim is to detect curved lanes and predict the turn depending on the curvature: either left or right turn. The dataset has a yellow and a white line and the task is to design an algorithm to detect these lanes on the road and predict the turn.

## Required Packages
1. Python3
2. Opencv 
3. Numpy

## Instructions to run the program

- git clone or download the zip folder

```
git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh1510/Curved_lanes_detection
```

- cd to the source folder

- Run main.py for simple lane detection

```
python3 main.py
```
